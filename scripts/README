Here is a description of the scripts in the scripts directory

1. Box_Plots
This generates box plots of V gene usage vs HLA allele dosage

2. Create_TCR_phenotype_file
This generates our V gene TCR phenotype file (from MixCR output) which we use for input into plink

3. GWAS plots
This generates Manhattan plots from plink output

4. HLA_plots
This generates locusplots from plink output

5. Amino acid omnibus test
This performs omnibus test on amino acids in each HLA position with V gene usage as the outcome variable

6. Create_kmer_phenotype_file
This generates our Kmer TCR phenotype file (from MixCR output) which we use for input into plink

7. Cytotoxicity
This generates our Kmer TCR phenotype file (from MixCR output) which we use for input into plink

8. Plink
This is an example of the plink commands we used to run the analysis
